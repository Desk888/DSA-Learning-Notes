# Linked Lists

### Introduction to Linked List Data Structure

A **linked list** is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains two parts:

1. **Data**: The value stored in the node.
2. **Next**: A reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations, making insertions and deletions more efficient. The most common types are:

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.

### Python Implementation of a Singly Linked List

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation:

`class Node:`
    `def __init__(self, data):`
        `"""Initialize a node with data and a pointer to the next node."""`
        `self.data = data`
        `self.next = None  # By default, the next pointer is None.`

`class LinkedList:`
    `def __init__(self):`
        `"""Initialize an empty linked list."""`
        `self.head = None  # The head points to the first node.`

    `def append(self, data):`
        `"""`
        `Add a node with the given data to the end of the list.`
        `If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head.`
        `"""`
        `new_node = Node(data)`
        `if not self.head:  # If the list is empty.`
            `self.head = new_node`
            `print(f"Added {data} as the head node.")`
            `return`
        `current = self.head`
        `while current.next:  # Traverse to the last node.`
            `current = current.next`
        `current.next = new_node  # Link the last node to the new node.`
        `print(f"Appended {data} to the linked list.")`

    `def display(self):`
        `"""Print all nodes in the list."""`
        `if not self.head:`
            `print("The linked list is empty.")`
            `return`
        `current = self.head`
        `print("Linked List:", end=" ")`
        `while current:`
            `print(current.data, end=" -> ")`
            `current = current.next`
        `print("None")  # End of the list.`

    `def delete(self, data):`
        `"""`
        `Delete the first node containing the given data.`
        `If the data is not found, do nothing.`
        `"""`
        `if not self.head:`
            `print("The linked list is empty. Nothing to delete.")`
            `return`
        `if self.head.data == data:  # If the head node is to be deleted.`
            `self.head = self.head.next`
            `print(f"Deleted {data} from the linked list.")`
            `return`
        `current = self.head`
        `while current.next and current.next.data != data:  # Traverse to find the node.`
            `current = current.next`
        `if current.next:  # If the data is found.`
            `current.next = current.next.next`
            `print(f"Deleted {data} from the linked list.")`
        `else:`
            `print(f"{data} not found in the linked list.")`
